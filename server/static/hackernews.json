To accomplish this, Token commissioned Datos Insights, a leading global data and advisory services firm for this research study that reveals the insights and perspectives of leading CISOs and workforce MFA leaders across the U.S. Datos Insights ditched the overused multiple choice questionnaire approach and conducted qualitative 60-minute video interviews to examine CISO perspectives in depth.

CISA reports that 90% of ransomware attacks are the result of phishing. </p> <style> .xm_container {display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 20px 10px 30px 0; background: #f9fbff; color: #160755; padding: 0 5%; border: 2px solid #d9deff; border-radius: 10px; text-align: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 0 #e2ebff; -webkit-border-top-left-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius-topleft: 25px; -webkit-border-bottom-right-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius-bottomright: 25px;} .ebook-image { flex: 0 0 200px; margin-right: 20px; } .ebook-details { flex: 1; }.ebook-details ul { margin: 15px; } .ebook-details ul li { margin-bottom: 5px; } @media (max-width: 600px) { .xm_container { flex-direction: column; } .ebook-image { margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 20px; } } </style> <div class=\"xm_container\"><div class=\"ebook-image\"><a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/report-ciso-perspectives-mfa-lp\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipfoK0iQnIwo6w89gDAZvRnhxY58tuk9i01pDNqKAxAmxbFvNe2tlfI6Z2KWSyk6zcDkkfvt2NP29ZXVHQdXwsbdq1QXLKfz6fXMGVbbj86ck_c683DzMkXesCJJXDGTqqD0m6Tb00pDQIPt1wRdUoJICbg2rymwEiECZAfY3TNntyLeppVGM-IpO1gFY/s728-rw-e365/Datos-Next%20Gen%20MFA-CTA.png\" alt=\"Generative AI\" title=\"Generative AI\" class=\"loaded\"></a></div> <div class=\"ebook-details\"> <p><strong>Increase your organization's security with insights from industry leaders.</strong> Download the <em>\"<a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/report-ciso-perspectives-mfa-lp\" target=\"_blank\">CISO Perspectives on Multifactor Authentication</a>\"</em> report to uncover how top CISOs are navigating the evolving landscape of identity and access management, and learn how you can implement cutting-edge MFA strategies to protect your workforce and fortify your defenses against emerging threats.</p> </div> </div> <p>Advanced Phishing Attacks remain the most effective tool in a hacker's arsenal. These attacks have become more targeted and sophisticated with the use of Gen AI. Gen AI also enables the launching of spear phishing attacks targeted at specific individuals within an organization on a large scale and with greater detail, leveraging real data about the organization and its employees to appear authentic. The tell-tale signs of phishing emails are rapidly disappearing as these emails are increasingly indistinguishable from legitimate communications. This will soon negate the value of user training.</p>\n<p>The above is further compounded by the rise of <a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/blog/deepfakes-interactive-deepfakes\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Deepfake technology</a> as Gen AI has given birth to new forms of social engineering attacks. Cybercriminals are now using AI-generated voices and videos to impersonate executives and other trusted individuals. These are being executed via phone calls from trusted phone numbers that are spoofed by the attackers and via Zoom conference calls where cybercriminals impersonate known and trusted colleagues. Attackers have been successful in convincing employees to transfer funds, share credentials, and perform other actions that can compromise security. These attacks exploit the inherent trust that employees place in familiar voices and faces, making them exceptionally dangerous. </p>\n<p>The tools to conduct these attacks are now available to billions on the dark web with no specialized skills required. Phishing and ransomware attacks were once the exclusive realm of expert cybercriminals, but with the advent of generative AI and new cybercrime tools, launching these attacks has become accessible to anyone with access to the dark web, which is anyone with a computing device and an internet connection. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and AI-driven tools available on the dark web have simplified the process, eliminating the need for advanced skills. This shift enables individuals with minimal technical knowledge to execute sophisticated cyberattacks with just a computer and internet connection. The gig economy meets the next generation of cyber attacks.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"new-attacks-require-new-defense-strategies\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>New attacks require new defense strategies</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#new-attacks-require-new-defense-strategies\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Phishing-Resistant MFA Adoption is critical and no longer a nice to have. With phishing attacks as the top cyber threat for enterprises, legacy MFA is being proven increasingly inadequate as the numbers of victims substantiate. Many legacy MFA solutions are decades-old technology. The current report highlights the urgency of deploying phishing-resistant, next-generation MFA solutions, especially in the face of AI-enhanced phishing attacks. CISOs should accelerate the shift toward MFA solutions that are hardware-based, use biometrics, and are FIDO compliant. These significantly mitigate phishing and ransomware attacks and would have prevented the overwhelming majority of current ransomware attacks saving organizations a combined billions of dollars in losses in the last year alone. </p>\n<p>Next-generation MFA is best implemented with targeted deployments for privileged users. The report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the deployment of next-generation MFA to high-risk users within the enterprise, particularly systems administrators and executives. CISOs need to improve risk management for System Administrators despite having privileged access management (PAM) solutions. \"PAM solutions have functioned as the historical norm for CISOs managing system admin risks.\" The rise of phishing and insider attacks necessitates that CISOs prioritize MFA upgrade deployments at this important business risk. The report found that senior executives at many firms lack robust security solutions aligned with their business functions and business risk. Almost none of the CISOs interviewed had distinct controls deployed for their executive users. With spear-phishing and other techniques on the rise, this gap was unexpected and troubling.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"conclusion\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#conclusion\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The techniques used by cybercriminals are constantly evolving, but never so rapidly as over the past twelve months. We have surpassed the capacity of our users to be our first line of cyber defense and we have not given them any new tools beyond those developed years or decades ago. By staying informed about the latest threats and implementing a multi-layered defense strategy that emphasizes upgrading to phishing-resistant, next-generation MFA, organizations can protect their users' identities and stop cybercriminals from gaining unauthorized access to data and sensitive operations. Protecting your users from new attacks requires vigilance, education, and the right tools. By prioritizing these areas, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack and maintain the trust of their customers and stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how Token's Next-Generation MFA can stop phishing and ransomware from harming your organization at <a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tokenring.com</a></p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"stophere\" id=\"hiddenH1\"></div>\n<div class=\"cf note-b\">Found this article interesting? <span class=\"\">This article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.</span> Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehackersnews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter <i class=\"icon-font icon-twitter\"></i></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/thehackernews/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> to read more exclusive content we post.</div>\n",

This is indeed the case with AD CS. Since AD CS is a core component of the modern Windows and Active Directory authentication and authorization framework, any vulnerabilities that exist pose a great risk to those environments. As we saw 6-7 years ago with Kerberos, and continue to see today, if key authentication infrastructure is compromised, it can be abused to great lengths. The same is the case with AD CS, if not to a greater extent. </p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvVCAhe55jr3RYfJp8nzS_wy6TiEbzbZ2Bpez8G5rq9ZL1rqtLoslq2V73pl6XuOj0LaSy9tiTPaAuItz-s8yMEePaFp1W7Y2RN7rEquBtcV9LKV0NmtTxG8xpcGjDV6y4yX_dQSKMxH-xAHHQRDHqky1H-UFl5HVv2nWQgtRXxH178XNWegaKGiyUAL4/s728-rw-e365/2.png\" style=\"clear: left; display: block; float: left; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvVCAhe55jr3RYfJp8nzS_wy6TiEbzbZ2Bpez8G5rq9ZL1rqtLoslq2V73pl6XuOj0LaSy9tiTPaAuItz-s8yMEePaFp1W7Y2RN7rEquBtcV9LKV0NmtTxG8xpcGjDV6y4yX_dQSKMxH-xAHHQRDHqky1H-UFl5HVv2nWQgtRXxH178XNWegaKGiyUAL4/s728-rw-e365/2.png\" alt=\"AD CS Vulnerabilities\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"730\" data-original-width=\"1600\" title=\"AD CS Vulnerabilities\" class=\"loaded\"></a></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"ad-cs-attack-basics\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>AD CS Attack Basics</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#ad-cs-attack-basics\">#</a></h2>\n<p>AD CS attacks rely on the fact that the domain trusts the Certificate Authority (\"CA\") server as much as it trusts its Kerberos servers and other identity servers. Think of the CA server as a gatekeeper. Just as a gatekeeper controls access to a secure area, the CA server controls the distribution and validation of certificates, ensuring that only trusted entities can gain access. </p>\n<p>However, AD CS attacks leverage this fact in order to circumvent the need for things like passwords or encryption keys. There are four major classes of AD CS vulnerabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ESC – This class of vulnerabilities results in some level of privilege escalation within the victim network / domain. Attackers can abuse these vulnerabilities to convert their access from a low- privileged user, to the domain administrator, with little to no effort.</li>\n<li>THEFT – These vulnerabilities are present when there are not significant security controls around the client endpoint, which allow for the authentication certificates to be stolen, resulting in either privilege escalation or persistence in the environment.</li>\n<li>PERSIST – As the name states, these vulnerabilities result in a situation in the network environment in which the attacker can abuse their access to a certificate in order to persist their access in an environment, without the need for a password.</li>\n<li>CVE – Separate from the first three classes, these vulnerabilities are based on abusing certain known vulnerabilities within AD CS that have patches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Critically worth noting is that, while Microsoft does track and have patches released for the AD CS vulnerabilities that have been assigned CVEs, for the majority of these vulnerabilities, Microsoft puts the onus of repair and security on the consumer, which leads to the presence of these vulnerabilities much more often.</p>\n<p>The most dangerous of the AD CS vulnerability categories is the ESC category (ESC as in privilege escalation). These pose the greatest threat to the user's environment as they require little to no privileges, depending on the specific misconfiguration. One such misconfiguration is the ESC2 vulnerability, which occurs from a server's need to impersonate certain users under particular circumstances. </p>\n<p>This attack allows a standard user to enroll for a certificate by impersonating them via the request's on-behalf-of field. By doing this, a standard low privileged user can pretend they are the domain administrator and request certificates, and later their NTLM hash, resulting in full compromise of the domain administrator account, and typically the whole domain. Check out the demo to see how an attacker might exploit this by using the AD CS hacking tool, <a href=\"https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Certipy.</a></p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVhDTZWSdDJUqBKIQH8AaEOE0k8g6kXuTMA0eYm12oZ96BMo4zXAMgxvorFePMOyiAJO7dy4r0pAebT5Qq3kTGGmKbA_TLcRBYvDpXviJuB9TpHJxt6W_KlP-ILhSU9O4dG4w_50hfKPuuLG6fRlP2SRC4OcnbnQMUPZh7P-gHzvF2rzNAEUghm3U1RGfy/s728-rw-e365/esc2-exploit.gif\" style=\"clear: left; display: block; float: left; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVhDTZWSdDJUqBKIQH8AaEOE0k8g6kXuTMA0eYm12oZ96BMo4zXAMgxvorFePMOyiAJO7dy4r0pAebT5Qq3kTGGmKbA_TLcRBYvDpXviJuB9TpHJxt6W_KlP-ILhSU9O4dG4w_50hfKPuuLG6fRlP2SRC4OcnbnQMUPZh7P-gHzvF2rzNAEUghm3U1RGfy/s728-rw-e365/esc2-exploit.gif\" alt=\"AD CS Vulnerabilities\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"921\" data-original-width=\"1458\" title=\"AD CS Vulnerabilities\" class=\"loaded\"></a></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"what-should-you-do\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>What should you do?</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#what-should-you-do\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As discussed, Microsoft does not have patches that make fixing or identifying these vulnerabilities easy for their users, so the responsibility falls on the users of AD CS to secure their own systems, which can be challenging.

    "description": " Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new campaign that potentially targets users in the Middle East through malware that disguises itself as Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect virtual private network (VPN) tool. \"The malware can execute remote PowerShell commands, download and exfiltrate files, encrypt communications, and bypass sandbox solutions, representing a significant threat to targeted organizations,\" Trend Micro researcher Mohamed Fahmy said in a technical report. The sophisticated malware sample has been observed employing a two-stage process and involves setting up connections to command-and-control (C2) infrastructure that purports to be a company VPN portal, allowing the threat actors to operate freely without tripping any alarms. The initial intrusion vector for the campaign is currently unknown, although it's suspected to involve the use of phishing techniques to deceive users into thinking that they are installing the GlobalProtect agent.

This is the product of stunning advancements in cybercriminal attack methods combined with a too-slow response by many organizations in adjusting to new attack methods. As predicted, Generative AI has indeed been a game changer for cybercriminals attacking organizations and it mandates urgent adjustments to cyber defense strategies. </p>\n<p>Through this remarkable transformation in threats, one thing that hasn't changed is the inherent human limitations of everyday users and this is why they are the preferred target for cybercriminals. No amount of training will ever imbue the average user with the super-skills required to detect advanced phishing campaigns or sophisticated deep fakes. </p>\n<p>To understand the impact, Token set out to collect perspectives on this pressing subject from cybersecurity leaders in their own words. To accomplish this, Token commissioned Datos Insights, a leading global data and advisory services firm for this research study that reveals the insights and perspectives of leading CISOs and workforce MFA leaders across the U.S. Datos Insights ditched the overused multiple choice questionnaire approach and conducted qualitative 60-minute video interviews to examine CISO perspectives in depth. In this article, we will examine the valuable insights gained from the research.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"cisos-are-unanimous-that-user-vulnerabilities-are-their-number-one-risk\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>CISOs are unanimous that user vulnerabilities are their number one risk</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#cisos-are-unanimous-that-user-vulnerabilities-are-their-number-one-risk\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Attack vectors are advancing in sophistication through the adoption of artificial intelligence capabilities, specifically generative AI, making them more difficult for CISOs and their teams to defend against. Cybercriminals most frequently target employees at large organizations through phishing attacks to gain network access. CISA reports that 90% of ransomware attacks are the result of phishing. </p> <style> .xm_container {display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 20px 10px 30px 0; background: #f9fbff; color: #160755; padding: 0 5%; border: 2px solid #d9deff; border-radius: 10px; text-align: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 0 #e2ebff; -webkit-border-top-left-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius-topleft: 25px; -webkit-border-bottom-right-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius-bottomright: 25px;} .ebook-image { flex: 0 0 200px; margin-right: 20px; } .ebook-details { flex: 1; }.ebook-details ul { margin: 15px; } .ebook-details ul li { margin-bottom: 5px; } @media (max-width: 600px) { .xm_container { flex-direction: column; } .ebook-image { margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 20px; } } </style> <div class=\"xm_container\"><div class=\"ebook-image\"><a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/report-ciso-perspectives-mfa-lp\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipfoK0iQnIwo6w89gDAZvRnhxY58tuk9i01pDNqKAxAmxbFvNe2tlfI6Z2KWSyk6zcDkkfvt2NP29ZXVHQdXwsbdq1QXLKfz6fXMGVbbj86ck_c683DzMkXesCJJXDGTqqD0m6Tb00pDQIPt1wRdUoJICbg2rymwEiECZAfY3TNntyLeppVGM-IpO1gFY/s728-rw-e365/Datos-Next%20Gen%20MFA-CTA.png\" alt=\"Generative AI\" title=\"Generative AI\" class=\"loaded\"></a></div> <div class=\"ebook-details\"> <p><strong>Increase your organization's security with insights from industry leaders.</strong> Download the <em>\"<a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/report-ciso-perspectives-mfa-lp\" target=\"_blank\">CISO Perspectives on Multifactor Authentication</a>\"</em> report to uncover how top CISOs are navigating the evolving landscape of identity and access management, and learn how you can implement cutting-edge MFA strategies to protect your workforce and fortify your defenses against emerging threats.</p> </div> </div> <p>Advanced Phishing Attacks remain the most effective tool in a hacker's arsenal. These attacks have become more targeted and sophisticated with the use of Gen AI. Gen AI also enables the launching of spear phishing attacks targeted at specific individuals within an organization on a large scale and with greater detail, leveraging real data about the organization and its employees to appear authentic. The tell-tale signs of phishing emails are rapidly disappearing as these emails are increasingly indistinguishable from legitimate communications. This will soon negate the value of user training.</p>\n<p>The above is further compounded by the rise of <a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/blog/deepfakes-interactive-deepfakes\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Deepfake technology</a> as Gen AI has given birth to new forms of social engineering attacks. Cybercriminals are now using AI-generated voices and videos to impersonate executives and other trusted individuals. These are being executed via phone calls from trusted phone numbers that are spoofed by the attackers and via Zoom conference calls where cybercriminals impersonate known and trusted colleagues. Attackers have been successful in convincing employees to transfer funds, share credentials, and perform other actions that can compromise security. These attacks exploit the inherent trust that employees place in familiar voices and faces, making them exceptionally dangerous. </p>\n<p>The tools to conduct these attacks are now available to billions on the dark web with no specialized skills required. Phishing and ransomware attacks were once the exclusive realm of expert cybercriminals, but with the advent of generative AI and new cybercrime tools, launching these attacks has become accessible to anyone with access to the dark web, which is anyone with a computing device and an internet connection. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and AI-driven tools available on the dark web have simplified the process, eliminating the need for advanced skills. This shift enables individuals with minimal technical knowledge to execute sophisticated cyberattacks with just a computer and internet connection. The gig economy meets the next generation of cyber attacks.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"new-attacks-require-new-defense-strategies\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>New attacks require new defense strategies</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#new-attacks-require-new-defense-strategies\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Phishing-Resistant MFA Adoption is critical and no longer a nice to have. With phishing attacks as the top cyber threat for enterprises, legacy MFA is being proven increasingly inadequate as the numbers of victims substantiate. Many legacy MFA solutions are decades-old technology. The current report highlights the urgency of deploying phishing-resistant, next-generation MFA solutions, especially in the face of AI-enhanced phishing attacks. CISOs should accelerate the shift toward MFA solutions that are hardware-based, use biometrics, and are FIDO compliant. These significantly mitigate phishing and ransomware attacks and would have prevented the overwhelming majority of current ransomware attacks saving organizations a combined billions of dollars in losses in the last year alone. </p>\n<p>Next-generation MFA is best implemented with targeted deployments for privileged users. The report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the deployment of next-generation MFA to high-risk users within the enterprise, particularly systems administrators and executives. CISOs need to improve risk management for System Administrators despite having privileged access management (PAM) solutions. \"PAM solutions have functioned as the historical norm for CISOs managing system admin risks.\" The rise of phishing and insider attacks necessitates that CISOs prioritize MFA upgrade deployments at this important business risk. The report found that senior executives at many firms lack robust security solutions aligned with their business functions and business risk. Almost none of the CISOs interviewed had distinct controls deployed for their executive users. With spear-phishing and other techniques on the rise, this gap was unexpected and troubling.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"conclusion\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#conclusion\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The techniques used by cybercriminals are constantly evolving, but never so rapidly as over the past twelve months. We have surpassed the capacity of our users to be our first line of cyber defense and we have not given them any new tools beyond those developed years or decades ago. By staying informed about the latest threats and implementing a multi-layered defense strategy that emphasizes upgrading to phishing-resistant, next-generation MFA, organizations can protect their users' identities and stop cybercriminals from gaining unauthorized access to data and sensitive operations. Protecting your users from new attacks requires vigilance, education, and the right tools. By prioritizing these areas, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack and maintain the trust of their customers and stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how Token's Next-Generation MFA can stop phishing and ransomware from harming your organization at <a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tokenring.com</a></p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"stophere\" id=\"hiddenH1\"></div>\n<div class=\"cf note-b\">Found this article interesting? <span class=\"\">This article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.</span> Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehackersnews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter <i class=\"icon-font icon-twitter\"></i></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/thehackernews/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> to read more exclusive content we post.</div>\n",

    "date": "Aug 31, 2024",
    "description": " A recently patched security flaw in Google Chrome and other Chromium web browsers was exploited as a zero-day by North Korean actors in a campaign designed to deliver the FudModule rootkit. The development is indicative of the persistent efforts made by the nation-state adversary, which had made a habit of incorporating rafts of Windows zero-day exploits into its arsenal in recent months.

This is indeed the case with AD CS. Since AD CS is a core component of the modern Windows and Active Directory authentication and authorization framework, any vulnerabilities that exist pose a great risk to those environments. As we saw 6-7 years ago with Kerberos, and continue to see today, if key authentication infrastructure is compromised, it can be abused to great lengths. The same is the case with AD CS, if not to a greater extent. </p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvVCAhe55jr3RYfJp8nzS_wy6TiEbzbZ2Bpez8G5rq9ZL1rqtLoslq2V73pl6XuOj0LaSy9tiTPaAuItz-s8yMEePaFp1W7Y2RN7rEquBtcV9LKV0NmtTxG8xpcGjDV6y4yX_dQSKMxH-xAHHQRDHqky1H-UFl5HVv2nWQgtRXxH178XNWegaKGiyUAL4/s728-rw-e365/2.png\" style=\"clear: left; display: block; float: left; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvVCAhe55jr3RYfJp8nzS_wy6TiEbzbZ2Bpez8G5rq9ZL1rqtLoslq2V73pl6XuOj0LaSy9tiTPaAuItz-s8yMEePaFp1W7Y2RN7rEquBtcV9LKV0NmtTxG8xpcGjDV6y4yX_dQSKMxH-xAHHQRDHqky1H-UFl5HVv2nWQgtRXxH178XNWegaKGiyUAL4/s728-rw-e365/2.png\" alt=\"AD CS Vulnerabilities\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"730\" data-original-width=\"1600\" title=\"AD CS Vulnerabilities\" class=\"loaded\"></a></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"ad-cs-attack-basics\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>AD CS Attack Basics</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#ad-cs-attack-basics\">#</a></h2>\n<p>AD CS attacks rely on the fact that the domain trusts the Certificate Authority (\"CA\") server as much as it trusts its Kerberos servers and other identity servers. Think of the CA server as a gatekeeper. Just as a gatekeeper controls access to a secure area, the CA server controls the distribution and validation of certificates, ensuring that only trusted entities can gain access. </p>\n<p>However, AD CS attacks leverage this fact in order to circumvent the need for things like passwords or encryption keys. There are four major classes of AD CS vulnerabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ESC – This class of vulnerabilities results in some level of privilege escalation within the victim network / domain. Attackers can abuse these vulnerabilities to convert their access from a low- privileged user, to the domain administrator, with little to no effort.</li>\n<li>THEFT – These vulnerabilities are present when there are not significant security controls around the client endpoint, which allow for the authentication certificates to be stolen, resulting in either privilege escalation or persistence in the environment.</li>\n<li>PERSIST – As the name states, these vulnerabilities result in a situation in the network environment in which the attacker can abuse their access to a certificate in order to persist their access in an environment, without the need for a password.</li>\n<li>CVE – Separate from the first three classes, these vulnerabilities are based on abusing certain known vulnerabilities within AD CS that have patches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Critically worth noting is that, while Microsoft does track and have patches released for the AD CS vulnerabilities that have been assigned CVEs, for the majority of these vulnerabilities, Microsoft puts the onus of repair and security on the consumer, which leads to the presence of these vulnerabilities much more often.</p>\n<p>The most dangerous of the AD CS vulnerability categories is the ESC category (ESC as in privilege escalation). These pose the greatest threat to the user's environment as they require little to no privileges, depending on the specific misconfiguration. One such misconfiguration is the ESC2 vulnerability, which occurs from a server's need to impersonate certain users under particular circumstances. </p>\n<p>This attack allows a standard user to enroll for a certificate by impersonating them via the request's on-behalf-of field. By doing this, a standard low privileged user can pretend they are the domain administrator and request certificates, and later their NTLM hash, resulting in full compromise of the domain administrator account, and typically the whole domain.

This is the product of stunning advancements in cybercriminal attack methods combined with a too-slow response by many organizations in adjusting to new attack methods. As predicted, Generative AI has indeed been a game changer for cybercriminals attacking organizations and it mandates urgent adjustments to cyber defense strategies. </p>\n<p>Through this remarkable transformation in threats, one thing that hasn't changed is the inherent human limitations of everyday users and this is why they are the preferred target for cybercriminals. No amount of training will ever imbue the average user with the super-skills required to detect advanced phishing campaigns or sophisticated deep fakes. </p>\n<p>To understand the impact, Token set out to collect perspectives on this pressing subject from cybersecurity leaders in their own words. To accomplish this, Token commissioned Datos Insights, a leading global data and advisory services firm for this research study that reveals the insights and perspectives of leading CISOs and workforce MFA leaders across the U.S. Datos Insights ditched the overused multiple choice questionnaire approach and conducted qualitative 60-minute video interviews to examine CISO perspectives in depth. In this article, we will examine the valuable insights gained from the research.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"cisos-are-unanimous-that-user-vulnerabilities-are-their-number-one-risk\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>CISOs are unanimous that user vulnerabilities are their number one risk</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#cisos-are-unanimous-that-user-vulnerabilities-are-their-number-one-risk\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Attack vectors are advancing in sophistication through the adoption of artificial intelligence capabilities, specifically generative AI, making them more difficult for CISOs and their teams to defend against. Cybercriminals most frequently target employees at large organizations through phishing attacks to gain network access. CISA reports that 90% of ransomware attacks are the result of phishing. </p> <style> .xm_container {display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 20px 10px 30px 0; background: #f9fbff; color: #160755; padding: 0 5%; border: 2px solid #d9deff; border-radius: 10px; text-align: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 0 #e2ebff; -webkit-border-top-left-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius-topleft: 25px; -webkit-border-bottom-right-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius-bottomright: 25px;} .ebook-image { flex: 0 0 200px; margin-right: 20px; } .ebook-details { flex: 1; }.ebook-details ul { margin: 15px; } .ebook-details ul li { margin-bottom: 5px; } @media (max-width: 600px) { .xm_container { flex-direction: column; } .ebook-image { margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 20px; } } </style> <div class=\"xm_container\"><div class=\"ebook-image\"><a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/report-ciso-perspectives-mfa-lp\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipfoK0iQnIwo6w89gDAZvRnhxY58tuk9i01pDNqKAxAmxbFvNe2tlfI6Z2KWSyk6zcDkkfvt2NP29ZXVHQdXwsbdq1QXLKfz6fXMGVbbj86ck_c683DzMkXesCJJXDGTqqD0m6Tb00pDQIPt1wRdUoJICbg2rymwEiECZAfY3TNntyLeppVGM-IpO1gFY/s728-rw-e365/Datos-Next%20Gen%20MFA-CTA.png\" alt=\"Generative AI\" title=\"Generative AI\" class=\"loaded\"></a></div> <div class=\"ebook-details\"> <p><strong>Increase your organization's security with insights from industry leaders.</strong> Download the <em>\"<a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/report-ciso-perspectives-mfa-lp\" target=\"_blank\">CISO Perspectives on Multifactor Authentication</a>\"</em> report to uncover how top CISOs are navigating the evolving landscape of identity and access management, and learn how you can implement cutting-edge MFA strategies to protect your workforce and fortify your defenses against emerging threats.</p> </div> </div> <p>Advanced Phishing Attacks remain the most effective tool in a hacker's arsenal. These attacks have become more targeted and sophisticated with the use of Gen AI. Gen AI also enables the launching of spear phishing attacks targeted at specific individuals within an organization on a large scale and with greater detail, leveraging real data about the organization and its employees to appear authentic. The tell-tale signs of phishing emails are rapidly disappearing as these emails are increasingly indistinguishable from legitimate communications. This will soon negate the value of user training.</p>\n<p>The above is further compounded by the rise of <a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/blog/deepfakes-interactive-deepfakes\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Deepfake technology</a> as Gen AI has given birth to new forms of social engineering attacks. Cybercriminals are now using AI-generated voices and videos to impersonate executives and other trusted individuals. These are being executed via phone calls from trusted phone numbers that are spoofed by the attackers and via Zoom conference calls where cybercriminals impersonate known and trusted colleagues. Attackers have been successful in convincing employees to transfer funds, share credentials, and perform other actions that can compromise security. These attacks exploit the inherent trust that employees place in familiar voices and faces, making them exceptionally dangerous. </p>\n<p>The tools to conduct these attacks are now available to billions on the dark web with no specialized skills required. Phishing and ransomware attacks were once the exclusive realm of expert cybercriminals, but with the advent of generative AI and new cybercrime tools, launching these attacks has become accessible to anyone with access to the dark web, which is anyone with a computing device and an internet connection. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and AI-driven tools available on the dark web have simplified the process, eliminating the need for advanced skills. This shift enables individuals with minimal technical knowledge to execute sophisticated cyberattacks with just a computer and internet connection. The gig economy meets the next generation of cyber attacks.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"new-attacks-require-new-defense-strategies\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>New attacks require new defense strategies</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#new-attacks-require-new-defense-strategies\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Phishing-Resistant MFA Adoption is critical and no longer a nice to have. With phishing attacks as the top cyber threat for enterprises, legacy MFA is being proven increasingly inadequate as the numbers of victims substantiate. Many legacy MFA solutions are decades-old technology. The current report highlights the urgency of deploying phishing-resistant, next-generation MFA solutions, especially in the face of AI-enhanced phishing attacks. CISOs should accelerate the shift toward MFA solutions that are hardware-based, use biometrics, and are FIDO compliant. These significantly mitigate phishing and ransomware attacks and would have prevented the overwhelming majority of current ransomware attacks saving organizations a combined billions of dollars in losses in the last year alone. </p>\n<p>Next-generation MFA is best implemented with targeted deployments for privileged users. The report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the deployment of next-generation MFA to high-risk users within the enterprise, particularly systems administrators and executives. CISOs need to improve risk management for System Administrators despite having privileged access management (PAM) solutions. \"PAM solutions have functioned as the historical norm for CISOs managing system admin risks.\" The rise of phishing and insider attacks necessitates that CISOs prioritize MFA upgrade deployments at this important business risk. The report found that senior executives at many firms lack robust security solutions aligned with their business functions and business risk. Almost none of the CISOs interviewed had distinct controls deployed for their executive users. With spear-phishing and other techniques on the rise, this gap was unexpected and troubling.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"conclusion\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#conclusion\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The techniques used by cybercriminals are constantly evolving, but never so rapidly as over the past twelve months. We have surpassed the capacity of our users to be our first line of cyber defense and we have not given them any new tools beyond those developed years or decades ago. By staying informed about the latest threats and implementing a multi-layered defense strategy that emphasizes upgrading to phishing-resistant, next-generation MFA, organizations can protect their users' identities and stop cybercriminals from gaining unauthorized access to data and sensitive operations. Protecting your users from new attacks requires vigilance, education, and the right tools. By prioritizing these areas, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack and maintain the trust of their customers and stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how Token's Next-Generation MFA can stop phishing and ransomware from harming your organization at <a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tokenring.com</a></p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"stophere\" id=\"hiddenH1\"></div>\n<div class=\"cf note-b\">Found this article interesting? <span class=\"\">This article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.</span> Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehackersnews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter <i class=\"icon-font icon-twitter\"></i></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/thehackernews/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> to read more exclusive content we post.</div>\n",

We are an ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certified company. Our <a href=\"https://www.ssh.com/solutions/ssh-secure-collaboration\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SalaX Secure Collaboration 2024</a> portfolio includes products that have achieved the TL IV security classification (EU restricted) by the NCSA function of Traficom, the official approver of cryptographic products in Finland. </p>\n<p>This is why SalaX Secure Collaboration 2024 is trusted by authorities, government bodies, banks, and law firms alike.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"2-default-security-setting-high\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>2.

There are ways to ramp up the security features of both solutions, but they either cost more or require extra configurations to work. What you need is a solution that has end-to-end encryption built-in, ensuring the messages are not decrypted at any point along the way. Senders and recipients can be verified using various strong authentication methods. Even we as the vendor cannot see any correspondence taking place via your authorized channels. </p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://info.ssh.com/how-to-protect-and-secure-your-vital-business-communications?utm_source=paid_media&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=thehackernews_secure_coll\" style=\"cursor: pointer; display: block; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSq-pIJ4KOHhyphenhyphen5YLpe3z43wuhBECyfj_vdTogo2hYYfG55YupVMCwmUoDZpu7H2R9SCIFFwyVZqSEvS0r-_q1SHgyA_3h9OB_5qUB-Mw2Kxkyf7cawtqyV3v2WZ7FbJor4OoV_BXLFX4DyVu4_68UWMJ_o-8LAw6jivMRFOIqfQ_4X0g6TEx7mmB-jp9Q/s728-rw-e365/ssh-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"496\" data-original-width=\"320\" class=\"loaded\"></a></div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"3-meet-data-sovereignty-requirements-with-flexible-deployment-options\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>3.

SalaX Secure Collaboration 2024 gives you the flexibility to host it in the public cloud, private cloud, or on-premises (or any combination in between) so that you have full control over your secure communication channels and can fully own your sensitive data if needed.

By ensuring that you and your co-communicators exchange your very private encryption keys before the communication even starts! Technically, it all happens under the hood, so it's easy for the user, but you do not start a conversation with anyone before you accept to receive communications from them with our solution.

The companies were guilty of sending and receiving off-channel communications using tools like WhatsApp and Signal.

The technology is Matrix, an open standard for interoperable, de-centralised, real-time communication over IP. Solutions like Slack integrate with it for a good reason.</p>\n<p>SalaX Secure Collaboration 2024 is built on the Matrix technology, allowing your business to join a network of organizations that are using a platform that is widely available for secure E2E communications. – with the benefit of the features only available in SalaX.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"salax-secure-collaboration-2024-messaging-videoaudio-calls-rooms-and-emails-in-a-single-platform\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>SalaX Secure Collaboration 2024: Messaging, video/audio calls, rooms, and emails in a single platform</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#salax-secure-collaboration-2024-messaging-videoaudio-calls-rooms-and-emails-in-a-single-platform\">#</a></h2>\n<p>SalaX Secure Collaboration 2024 is a comprehensive and super-secure collaboration platform for the most common business-critical and sensitive communication instances.

This is indeed the case with AD CS. Since AD CS is a core component of the modern Windows and Active Directory authentication and authorization framework, any vulnerabilities that exist pose a great risk to those environments. As we saw 6-7 years ago with Kerberos, and continue to see today, if key authentication infrastructure is compromised, it can be abused to great lengths. The same is the case with AD CS, if not to a greater extent. </p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvVCAhe55jr3RYfJp8nzS_wy6TiEbzbZ2Bpez8G5rq9ZL1rqtLoslq2V73pl6XuOj0LaSy9tiTPaAuItz-s8yMEePaFp1W7Y2RN7rEquBtcV9LKV0NmtTxG8xpcGjDV6y4yX_dQSKMxH-xAHHQRDHqky1H-UFl5HVv2nWQgtRXxH178XNWegaKGiyUAL4/s728-rw-e365/2.png\" style=\"clear: left; display: block; float: left; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvVCAhe55jr3RYfJp8nzS_wy6TiEbzbZ2Bpez8G5rq9ZL1rqtLoslq2V73pl6XuOj0LaSy9tiTPaAuItz-s8yMEePaFp1W7Y2RN7rEquBtcV9LKV0NmtTxG8xpcGjDV6y4yX_dQSKMxH-xAHHQRDHqky1H-UFl5HVv2nWQgtRXxH178XNWegaKGiyUAL4/s728-rw-e365/2.png\" alt=\"AD CS Vulnerabilities\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"730\" data-original-width=\"1600\" title=\"AD CS Vulnerabilities\" class=\"loaded\"></a></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"ad-cs-attack-basics\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>AD CS Attack Basics</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#ad-cs-attack-basics\">#</a></h2>\n<p>AD CS attacks rely on the fact that the domain trusts the Certificate Authority (\"CA\") server as much as it trusts its Kerberos servers and other identity servers. Think of the CA server as a gatekeeper. Just as a gatekeeper controls access to a secure area, the CA server controls the distribution and validation of certificates, ensuring that only trusted entities can gain access. </p>\n<p>However, AD CS attacks leverage this fact in order to circumvent the need for things like passwords or encryption keys. There are four major classes of AD CS vulnerabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ESC – This class of vulnerabilities results in some level of privilege escalation within the victim network / domain. Attackers can abuse these vulnerabilities to convert their access from a low- privileged user, to the domain administrator, with little to no effort.</li>\n<li>THEFT – These vulnerabilities are present when there are not significant security controls around the client endpoint, which allow for the authentication certificates to be stolen, resulting in either privilege escalation or persistence in the environment.</li>\n<li>PERSIST – As the name states, these vulnerabilities result in a situation in the network environment in which the attacker can abuse their access to a certificate in order to persist their access in an environment, without the need for a password.</li>\n<li>CVE – Separate from the first three classes, these vulnerabilities are based on abusing certain known vulnerabilities within AD CS that have patches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Critically worth noting is that, while Microsoft does track and have patches released for the AD CS vulnerabilities that have been assigned CVEs, for the majority of these vulnerabilities, Microsoft puts the onus of repair and security on the consumer, which leads to the presence of these vulnerabilities much more often.</p>\n<p>The most dangerous of the AD CS vulnerability categories is the ESC category (ESC as in privilege escalation). These pose the greatest threat to the user's environment as they require little to no privileges, depending on the specific misconfiguration. One such misconfiguration is the ESC2 vulnerability, which occurs from a server's need to impersonate certain users under particular circumstances. </p>\n<p>This attack allows a standard user to enroll for a certificate by impersonating them via the request's on-behalf-of field. By doing this, a standard low privileged user can pretend they are the domain administrator and request certificates, and later their NTLM hash, resulting in full compromise of the domain administrator account, and typically the whole domain.

The activity has not been attributed to a specific threat actor or group.</p> <p>The starting point is a setup.exe binary that deploys the primary backdoor component called GlobalProtect.exe, which, when installed, initiates a beaconing process that alerts the operators of the progress.</p> <p>The first-stage executable is also responsible for dropping two additional configuration files (RTime.conf and ApProcessId.conf) that are used to exfiltrate system information to a C2 server (94.131.108[.]78), including the victim's IP address, operating system information, username, machine name, and sleep time sequence.</p> <p>\"The malware implements an evasion technique to bypass behavior analysis and sandbox solutions by checking the process file path and the specific file before executing the main code block,\" Fahmy noted.</p> <p>The backdoor serves as a conduit to upload files, download next-stage payloads, and execute PowerShell commands.

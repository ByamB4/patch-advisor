It is part of the Microsoft 365 family of products since 2015.</p>\n<p>The cybersecurity firm said it observed a 2,000-fold increase in traffic to unique Microsoft Sway phishing pages starting July 2024 with the ultimate goal of stealing users' Microsoft 365 credentials. This is achieved by serving bogus QR codes hosted on Sway that, when scanned, redirect the users to phishing websites.</p>\n<p>In a further attempt to evade static analysis efforts, some of these quishing campaigns have been observed to use <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/cybercriminals-abusing-cloudflare-r2.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudflare Turnstile</a> as a way to hide the domains from static URL scanners.</p>\n<p>The activity is also notable for leveraging adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing tactics – i.e., <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/new-tricks-in-phishing-playbook.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">transparent phishing</a> – to siphon credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes using lookalike login pages, while simultaneously attempting to log the victim into the service.</p>\n<p>\"Using QR codes to redirect victims to phishing websites poses some challenges to defenders,\" Michael Alcantara said. \"Since the URL is embedded inside an image, email scanners that can only scan text-based content can get bypassed.\"</p>\n<p>\"Additionally, when a user gets sent a QR code, they may use another device, such as their mobile phone, to scan the code. Since the security measures implemented on mobile devices, particularly personal cell phones, are typically not as stringent as laptops and desktops, victims are then often more vulnerable to abuse.\"</p>\n<p>This is not the first time phishing attacks have abused Microsoft Sway. In April 2020, Group-IB detailed a campaign dubbed <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/04/targeted-phishing-attacks-successfully.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PerSwaysion</a> that successfully compromised corporate email accounts of at least 156 high-ranking officers at various firms based in Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Singapore by using Sway as the jumping board to redirect victims to credential harvesting sites.</p>\n<section class=\"dog_two clear\"><center class=\"cf\"><a href=\"https://thehackernews.uk/cis-image-hn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cybersecurity\"><img class=\"lazyload loaded\" alt=\"Cybersecurity\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOgdSfrS_yHoZPFJoZ5_OerKJ2U-kw-e9RRvvw0jcPMFxPVoehVj0lql2GCIFXI-7mX8QG7vt-UizONWkKz1rof-0jZ8Z5UN9dhfKskmwoWtviYH6UX7lVBfebTQzrkXinbeV3xWzdUCHDGm1ngBUck3ljYO8bHbLRWXGxMEVu4q2AZDZsdE4l0yrnjtdG/s728-rw-e100/cis-d.png\" width=\"727\" height=\"90\"></a></center></section>\n<p>The development comes as quishing campaigns are getting more sophisticated as security vendors develop countermeasures to detect and block such image-based threats.</p>\n<p>\"In a clever twist, attackers have now begun crafting QR codes using Unicode text characters instead of images,\" SlashNext CTO J.

The framework it lays out helps to make an ever-growing attack surface manageable. </p>\n<p>The recent reorganization of categories aims to help enterprises identify the security vendors that are best equipped to support <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/blueprint-for-success-implementing-ctem.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CTEM implementation</a>. </p>\n<p>Threat Exposure Management represents the overall set of technologies and processes used to manage threat exposure, under the governance of a CTEM program. It encompasses the two new CTEM related categories described below.</p>\n<p>Vulnerability Assessment and Vulnerability Prioritization Technology capabilities have been merged into one new category, Exposure Assessment Platforms (EAP). EAPs aim to streamline vulnerability management and enhance operational efficiency, undoubtedly why Gartner has given this category a high benefit rating. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV) merges Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) with Automated Pentesting and Red Teaming into one newly created function that's focused on providing continuous, automated evidence of exposure. AEV is expected to have great market growth for its ability to validate cyber resilience from the adversarial point of view, challenging the organization's IT defenses with real-world attack techniques. </p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAytUNf2G3-yY8uoX7ffVfraR68onrK3LC_nL_VotMie-C1okqjsUkx0CLm8Dt_0YWWGjqyfWzBayLYALTkoypeXuwY4REShDKtWnvUom-Yld_mN9As77iQzDERrG_3OXs_6fBXcjvSQMonmRwDYXPm3gYGp5ApMknkUPJ6yzOlKZgVv9JgtNUh2Pk2o/s728-rw-e365/1.png\" style=\"clear: left; display: block; float: left; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAytUNf2G3-yY8uoX7ffVfraR68onrK3LC_nL_VotMie-C1okqjsUkx0CLm8Dt_0YWWGjqyfWzBayLYALTkoypeXuwY4REShDKtWnvUom-Yld_mN9As77iQzDERrG_3OXs_6fBXcjvSQMonmRwDYXPm3gYGp5ApMknkUPJ6yzOlKZgVv9JgtNUh2Pk2o/s728-rw-e365/1.png\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"461\" data-original-width=\"920\" class=\"loaded\"></a></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"what-do-eaps-offer\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>What do EAPs offer?</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#what-do-eaps-offer\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A few things, but for a start, they make you less dependent on CVSS scores for prioritizing vulnerabilities. While a useful indicator, that's all it is, an indicator. The CVSS score doesn't tell you how exploitable a vulnerability is in the context of your specific environment and threat landscape. The data provided within an EAP set-up is much more contextualized with threat intelligence and asset criticality information. It serves insights in a way that supports action, rather than oceans of data points.</p>\n<p>This added contextualization also means vulnerabilities can be flagged in terms of posing a business risk. Does a poorly configured device that no one ever uses and isn't connected to anything, need to be patched? EAPs help to direct efforts towards addressing vulnerabilities that are not just exploitable, but actually lead to assets that hold business significance, either for its data or for operational continuity.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"the-value-of-aev\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>The Value of AEV?</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#the-value-of-aev\">#</a></h2>\n<p>While EAPs leverage scans and data sources to provide exposure context, they are limited to theoretical data analysis without actual evidence of exploitable attack paths. And that's where AEV comes in, it confirms exposures from an adversary's point of view. AEV involves running adversarial attacks to see which security gaps are actually exploitable in your specific environment and how far an attacker would get if they were to be exploited. </p>\n<p>In short, AEV takes threats from the playbook to the playground.</p>\n<p>Yet there are other benefits too; it makes running a red team much easier to get off the ground. Red teams require a unique set of talents and tools that are hard to develop and obtain. Having an automated AEV product to conduct numerous red-teamer tasks helps to lower that threshold of entry, giving you a more-than-decent baseline from which to build.</p>\n<p>AEV also helps to make a large attack surface more manageable. Easing the load of security staff, automated test runs can be executed routinely, consistently, and across multiple locations, leaving any aspiring red teamer to focus only on high-priority areas. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"where-the-tough-gets-going\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>Where the Tough Gets Going</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#where-the-tough-gets-going\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Not all a hedge of roses, there are some thorns that companies need to clip to get the full potential out of their Threat Exposure Management initiatives. </p>\n<p>When it comes to EAP, it's important to get thinking beyond compliance and CVSS scores. A mind shift is required from viewing assessments as tick-box activities. In this limited context, vulnerabilities are listed as isolated threats, and you'll end up missing the difference between knowing there are vulnerabilities and prioritizing those vulnerabilities according to their exploitability and potential impact. </p>\n<p>On the AEV side, one challenge is finding the right technology solution that will cover all bases. While many vendors offer attack simulations and/or automated penetration testing, they're typically seen as distinct functions. Security teams looking to validate both the true effectiveness of their security controls and the true exploitability of security flaws may choose to implement multiple products separately.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"the-going-get-proactive\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>The Going Get Proactive</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#the-going-get-proactive\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The evolution of the CTEM framework since its introduction two years ago indicates the growing acceptance of the critical need for a proactive risk exposure reduction mindset. The new categorization presented in the Hype Cycle reflects the growing maturity of products in this space, supporting the operationalization of CTEM.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the AEV category, our recommendation is to use a solution that will seamlessly integrate BAS and penetration testing capabilities, as this is not a common feature for most tools. Look for agentless technologies that accurately replicate attacker techniques and ease operational demands. This unique combination ensures that security teams can validate their security posture continuously and with real-world relevance.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how Pentera is used as an essential element of any CTEM strategy that empowers enterprises to maintain a robust and dynamic security posture, continuously validated against the latest threats.</p>\n<p>For more insight into Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM), <a href=\"https://xposure.pentera.io/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=xposure\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">join us at the XPOSURE Summit 2024</a>, hosted by Pentera, and grab the <a href=\"https://pentera.io/redirect-access-gartner-2024-hype-cycle-for-security-operations/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=gartner_hype_2024\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner® 2024 Hype Cycle for Security Operations</a> report.</p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"stophere\" id=\"hiddenH1\"></div>\n<div class=\"cf note-b\">Found this article interesting? <span class=\"\">This article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.</span> Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehackersnews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter <i class=\"icon-font icon-twitter\"></i></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/thehackernews/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> to read more exclusive content we post.</div>\n",

It is part of the Microsoft 365 family of products since 2015.</p>\n<p>The cybersecurity firm said it observed a 2,000-fold increase in traffic to unique Microsoft Sway phishing pages starting July 2024 with the ultimate goal of stealing users' Microsoft 365 credentials. This is achieved by serving bogus QR codes hosted on Sway that, when scanned, redirect the users to phishing websites.</p>\n<p>In a further attempt to evade static analysis efforts, some of these quishing campaigns have been observed to use <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/cybercriminals-abusing-cloudflare-r2.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudflare Turnstile</a> as a way to hide the domains from static URL scanners.</p>\n<p>The activity is also notable for leveraging adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing tactics – i.e., <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/new-tricks-in-phishing-playbook.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">transparent phishing</a> – to siphon credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes using lookalike login pages, while simultaneously attempting to log the victim into the service.</p>\n<p>\"Using QR codes to redirect victims to phishing websites poses some challenges to defenders,\" Michael Alcantara said. \"Since the URL is embedded inside an image, email scanners that can only scan text-based content can get bypassed.\"</p>\n<p>\"Additionally, when a user gets sent a QR code, they may use another device, such as their mobile phone, to scan the code. Since the security measures implemented on mobile devices, particularly personal cell phones, are typically not as stringent as laptops and desktops, victims are then often more vulnerable to abuse.\"</p>\n<p>This is not the first time phishing attacks have abused Microsoft Sway. In April 2020, Group-IB detailed a campaign dubbed <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/04/targeted-phishing-attacks-successfully.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PerSwaysion</a> that successfully compromised corporate email accounts of at least 156 high-ranking officers at various firms based in Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Singapore by using Sway as the jumping board to redirect victims to credential harvesting sites.</p>\n<section class=\"dog_two clear\"><center class=\"cf\"><a href=\"https://thehackernews.uk/cis-image-hn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cybersecurity\"><img class=\"lazyload loaded\" alt=\"Cybersecurity\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOgdSfrS_yHoZPFJoZ5_OerKJ2U-kw-e9RRvvw0jcPMFxPVoehVj0lql2GCIFXI-7mX8QG7vt-UizONWkKz1rof-0jZ8Z5UN9dhfKskmwoWtviYH6UX7lVBfebTQzrkXinbeV3xWzdUCHDGm1ngBUck3ljYO8bHbLRWXGxMEVu4q2AZDZsdE4l0yrnjtdG/s728-rw-e100/cis-d.png\" width=\"727\" height=\"90\"></a></center></section>\n<p>The development comes as quishing campaigns are getting more sophisticated as security vendors develop countermeasures to detect and block such image-based threats.</p>\n<p>\"In a clever twist, attackers have now begun crafting QR codes using Unicode text characters instead of images,\" SlashNext CTO J.

    "date": "Aug 28, 2024",
    "description": " A critical security flaw has been disclosed in the WPML WordPress multilingual plugin that could allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code remotely under certain circumstances. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-6386 (CVSS score: 9.9), impacts all versions of the plugin before 4.6.13, which was released on August 20, 2024. Arising due to missing input validation and sanitization, the issue makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server. WPML is a popular plugin used for building multilingual WordPress sites. It has over one million active installations.

Pentera, listed <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pentera-recognized-as-a-sample-vendor-for-adversarial-exposure-validation-in-gartner-hype-cycle-for-security-operations-2024-302218159.html?tc=eml_cleartime\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">as a sample vendor</a> in the newly defined AEV category, is playing a pivotal role in increasing the adoption of CTEM, with a focus on security validation. Following is our take on the CTEM related product categories and what they mean for enterprise security leaders.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"the-industry-is-maturing\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>The Industry is Maturing</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#the-industry-is-maturing\">#</a></h2>\n<p>CTEM, coined by Gartner in 2022, presents a structural approach for continuously assessing, prioritizing, validating, and remediating exposures in an organization's attack surface, enabling businesses to mobilize response to the most critical risks. The framework it lays out helps to make an ever-growing attack surface manageable. </p>\n<p>The recent reorganization of categories aims to help enterprises identify the security vendors that are best equipped to support <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/blueprint-for-success-implementing-ctem.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CTEM implementation</a>. </p>\n<p>Threat Exposure Management represents the overall set of technologies and processes used to manage threat exposure, under the governance of a CTEM program. It encompasses the two new CTEM related categories described below.</p>\n<p>Vulnerability Assessment and Vulnerability Prioritization Technology capabilities have been merged into one new category, Exposure Assessment Platforms (EAP). EAPs aim to streamline vulnerability management and enhance operational efficiency, undoubtedly why Gartner has given this category a high benefit rating. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV) merges Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) with Automated Pentesting and Red Teaming into one newly created function that's focused on providing continuous, automated evidence of exposure. AEV is expected to have great market growth for its ability to validate cyber resilience from the adversarial point of view, challenging the organization's IT defenses with real-world attack techniques. </p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAytUNf2G3-yY8uoX7ffVfraR68onrK3LC_nL_VotMie-C1okqjsUkx0CLm8Dt_0YWWGjqyfWzBayLYALTkoypeXuwY4REShDKtWnvUom-Yld_mN9As77iQzDERrG_3OXs_6fBXcjvSQMonmRwDYXPm3gYGp5ApMknkUPJ6yzOlKZgVv9JgtNUh2Pk2o/s728-rw-e365/1.png\" style=\"clear: left; display: block; float: left; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAytUNf2G3-yY8uoX7ffVfraR68onrK3LC_nL_VotMie-C1okqjsUkx0CLm8Dt_0YWWGjqyfWzBayLYALTkoypeXuwY4REShDKtWnvUom-Yld_mN9As77iQzDERrG_3OXs_6fBXcjvSQMonmRwDYXPm3gYGp5ApMknkUPJ6yzOlKZgVv9JgtNUh2Pk2o/s728-rw-e365/1.png\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"461\" data-original-width=\"920\" class=\"loaded\"></a></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"what-do-eaps-offer\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>What do EAPs offer?</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#what-do-eaps-offer\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A few things, but for a start, they make you less dependent on CVSS scores for prioritizing vulnerabilities. While a useful indicator, that's all it is, an indicator. The CVSS score doesn't tell you how exploitable a vulnerability is in the context of your specific environment and threat landscape. The data provided within an EAP set-up is much more contextualized with threat intelligence and asset criticality information. It serves insights in a way that supports action, rather than oceans of data points.</p>\n<p>This added contextualization also means vulnerabilities can be flagged in terms of posing a business risk. Does a poorly configured device that no one ever uses and isn't connected to anything, need to be patched? EAPs help to direct efforts towards addressing vulnerabilities that are not just exploitable, but actually lead to assets that hold business significance, either for its data or for operational continuity.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"the-value-of-aev\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>The Value of AEV?</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#the-value-of-aev\">#</a></h2>\n<p>While EAPs leverage scans and data sources to provide exposure context, they are limited to theoretical data analysis without actual evidence of exploitable attack paths. And that's where AEV comes in, it confirms exposures from an adversary's point of view. AEV involves running adversarial attacks to see which security gaps are actually exploitable in your specific environment and how far an attacker would get if they were to be exploited. </p>\n<p>In short, AEV takes threats from the playbook to the playground.</p>\n<p>Yet there are other benefits too; it makes running a red team much easier to get off the ground. Red teams require a unique set of talents and tools that are hard to develop and obtain. Having an automated AEV product to conduct numerous red-teamer tasks helps to lower that threshold of entry, giving you a more-than-decent baseline from which to build.</p>\n<p>AEV also helps to make a large attack surface more manageable. Easing the load of security staff, automated test runs can be executed routinely, consistently, and across multiple locations, leaving any aspiring red teamer to focus only on high-priority areas. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"where-the-tough-gets-going\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>Where the Tough Gets Going</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#where-the-tough-gets-going\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Not all a hedge of roses, there are some thorns that companies need to clip to get the full potential out of their Threat Exposure Management initiatives. </p>\n<p>When it comes to EAP, it's important to get thinking beyond compliance and CVSS scores. A mind shift is required from viewing assessments as tick-box activities. In this limited context, vulnerabilities are listed as isolated threats, and you'll end up missing the difference between knowing there are vulnerabilities and prioritizing those vulnerabilities according to their exploitability and potential impact. </p>\n<p>On the AEV side, one challenge is finding the right technology solution that will cover all bases. While many vendors offer attack simulations and/or automated penetration testing, they're typically seen as distinct functions. Security teams looking to validate both the true effectiveness of their security controls and the true exploitability of security flaws may choose to implement multiple products separately.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"the-going-get-proactive\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>The Going Get Proactive</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#the-going-get-proactive\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The evolution of the CTEM framework since its introduction two years ago indicates the growing acceptance of the critical need for a proactive risk exposure reduction mindset. The new categorization presented in the Hype Cycle reflects the growing maturity of products in this space, supporting the operationalization of CTEM.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the AEV category, our recommendation is to use a solution that will seamlessly integrate BAS and penetration testing capabilities, as this is not a common feature for most tools. Look for agentless technologies that accurately replicate attacker techniques and ease operational demands. This unique combination ensures that security teams can validate their security posture continuously and with real-world relevance.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how Pentera is used as an essential element of any CTEM strategy that empowers enterprises to maintain a robust and dynamic security posture, continuously validated against the latest threats.</p>\n<p>For more insight into Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM), <a href=\"https://xposure.pentera.io/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=xposure\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">join us at the XPOSURE Summit 2024</a>, hosted by Pentera, and grab the <a href=\"https://pentera.io/redirect-access-gartner-2024-hype-cycle-for-security-operations/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=gartner_hype_2024\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner® 2024 Hype Cycle for Security Operations</a> report.</p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"stophere\" id=\"hiddenH1\"></div>\n<div class=\"cf note-b\">Found this article interesting? <span class=\"\">This article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.</span> Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehackersnews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter <i class=\"icon-font icon-twitter\"></i></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/thehackernews/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> to read more exclusive content we post.</div>\n",

It is part of the Microsoft 365 family of products since 2015.</p>\n<p>The cybersecurity firm said it observed a 2,000-fold increase in traffic to unique Microsoft Sway phishing pages starting July 2024 with the ultimate goal of stealing users' Microsoft 365 credentials. This is achieved by serving bogus QR codes hosted on Sway that, when scanned, redirect the users to phishing websites.</p>\n<p>In a further attempt to evade static analysis efforts, some of these quishing campaigns have been observed to use <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/cybercriminals-abusing-cloudflare-r2.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudflare Turnstile</a> as a way to hide the domains from static URL scanners.</p>\n<p>The activity is also notable for leveraging adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing tactics – i.e., <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/new-tricks-in-phishing-playbook.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">transparent phishing</a> – to siphon credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes using lookalike login pages, while simultaneously attempting to log the victim into the service.</p>\n<p>\"Using QR codes to redirect victims to phishing websites poses some challenges to defenders,\" Michael Alcantara said. \"Since the URL is embedded inside an image, email scanners that can only scan text-based content can get bypassed.\"</p>\n<p>\"Additionally, when a user gets sent a QR code, they may use another device, such as their mobile phone, to scan the code. Since the security measures implemented on mobile devices, particularly personal cell phones, are typically not as stringent as laptops and desktops, victims are then often more vulnerable to abuse.\"</p>\n<p>This is not the first time phishing attacks have abused Microsoft Sway. In April 2020, Group-IB detailed a campaign dubbed <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/04/targeted-phishing-attacks-successfully.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PerSwaysion</a> that successfully compromised corporate email accounts of at least 156 high-ranking officers at various firms based in Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Singapore by using Sway as the jumping board to redirect victims to credential harvesting sites.</p>\n<section class=\"dog_two clear\"><center class=\"cf\"><a href=\"https://thehackernews.uk/cis-image-hn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cybersecurity\"><img class=\"lazyload loaded\" alt=\"Cybersecurity\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOgdSfrS_yHoZPFJoZ5_OerKJ2U-kw-e9RRvvw0jcPMFxPVoehVj0lql2GCIFXI-7mX8QG7vt-UizONWkKz1rof-0jZ8Z5UN9dhfKskmwoWtviYH6UX7lVBfebTQzrkXinbeV3xWzdUCHDGm1ngBUck3ljYO8bHbLRWXGxMEVu4q2AZDZsdE4l0yrnjtdG/s728-rw-e100/cis-d.png\" width=\"727\" height=\"90\"></a></center></section>\n<p>The development comes as quishing campaigns are getting more sophisticated as security vendors develop countermeasures to detect and block such image-based threats.</p>\n<p>\"In a clever twist, attackers have now begun crafting QR codes using Unicode text characters instead of images,\" SlashNext CTO J.

Furthermore, the Unicode QR codes can be rendered perfectly on screens sans any issue and look markedly different when viewed in plain text, further complicating detection efforts.</p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"stophere\" id=\"hiddenH1\"></div>\n<div class=\"cf note-b\">Found this article interesting?

    "description": " A critical security flaw has been disclosed in the WPML WordPress multilingual plugin that could allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code remotely under certain circumstances. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-6386 (CVSS score: 9.9), impacts all versions of the plugin before 4.6.13, which was released on August 20, 2024. Arising due to missing input validation and sanitization, the issue makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server. WPML is a popular plugin used for building multilingual WordPress sites. It has over one million active installations. Security researcher stealthcopter, who discovered and reported CVE-2024-6386, said the problem lies in the plugin's handling of shortcodes that are used to insert post content such as audio, images, and videos. \"Specifically, the plugin uses Twig templates for rendering content in shortcodes but fails to properly sanitize input, leadi",

Following is our take on the CTEM related product categories and what they mean for enterprise security leaders.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"the-industry-is-maturing\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>The Industry is Maturing</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#the-industry-is-maturing\">#</a></h2>\n<p>CTEM, coined by Gartner in 2022, presents a structural approach for continuously assessing, prioritizing, validating, and remediating exposures in an organization's attack surface, enabling businesses to mobilize response to the most critical risks. The framework it lays out helps to make an ever-growing attack surface manageable. </p>\n<p>The recent reorganization of categories aims to help enterprises identify the security vendors that are best equipped to support <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/blueprint-for-success-implementing-ctem.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CTEM implementation</a>. </p>\n<p>Threat Exposure Management represents the overall set of technologies and processes used to manage threat exposure, under the governance of a CTEM program. It encompasses the two new CTEM related categories described below.</p>\n<p>Vulnerability Assessment and Vulnerability Prioritization Technology capabilities have been merged into one new category, Exposure Assessment Platforms (EAP). EAPs aim to streamline vulnerability management and enhance operational efficiency, undoubtedly why Gartner has given this category a high benefit rating. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV) merges Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) with Automated Pentesting and Red Teaming into one newly created function that's focused on providing continuous, automated evidence of exposure. AEV is expected to have great market growth for its ability to validate cyber resilience from the adversarial point of view, challenging the organization's IT defenses with real-world attack techniques. </p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAytUNf2G3-yY8uoX7ffVfraR68onrK3LC_nL_VotMie-C1okqjsUkx0CLm8Dt_0YWWGjqyfWzBayLYALTkoypeXuwY4REShDKtWnvUom-Yld_mN9As77iQzDERrG_3OXs_6fBXcjvSQMonmRwDYXPm3gYGp5ApMknkUPJ6yzOlKZgVv9JgtNUh2Pk2o/s728-rw-e365/1.png\" style=\"clear: left; display: block; float: left; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidAytUNf2G3-yY8uoX7ffVfraR68onrK3LC_nL_VotMie-C1okqjsUkx0CLm8Dt_0YWWGjqyfWzBayLYALTkoypeXuwY4REShDKtWnvUom-Yld_mN9As77iQzDERrG_3OXs_6fBXcjvSQMonmRwDYXPm3gYGp5ApMknkUPJ6yzOlKZgVv9JgtNUh2Pk2o/s728-rw-e365/1.png\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"461\" data-original-width=\"920\" class=\"loaded\"></a></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"what-do-eaps-offer\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>What do EAPs offer?</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#what-do-eaps-offer\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A few things, but for a start, they make you less dependent on CVSS scores for prioritizing vulnerabilities. While a useful indicator, that's all it is, an indicator. The CVSS score doesn't tell you how exploitable a vulnerability is in the context of your specific environment and threat landscape. The data provided within an EAP set-up is much more contextualized with threat intelligence and asset criticality information. It serves insights in a way that supports action, rather than oceans of data points.</p>\n<p>This added contextualization also means vulnerabilities can be flagged in terms of posing a business risk. Does a poorly configured device that no one ever uses and isn't connected to anything, need to be patched? EAPs help to direct efforts towards addressing vulnerabilities that are not just exploitable, but actually lead to assets that hold business significance, either for its data or for operational continuity.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"the-value-of-aev\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>The Value of AEV?</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#the-value-of-aev\">#</a></h2>\n<p>While EAPs leverage scans and data sources to provide exposure context, they are limited to theoretical data analysis without actual evidence of exploitable attack paths. And that's where AEV comes in, it confirms exposures from an adversary's point of view. AEV involves running adversarial attacks to see which security gaps are actually exploitable in your specific environment and how far an attacker would get if they were to be exploited. </p>\n<p>In short, AEV takes threats from the playbook to the playground.</p>\n<p>Yet there are other benefits too; it makes running a red team much easier to get off the ground. Red teams require a unique set of talents and tools that are hard to develop and obtain. Having an automated AEV product to conduct numerous red-teamer tasks helps to lower that threshold of entry, giving you a more-than-decent baseline from which to build.</p>\n<p>AEV also helps to make a large attack surface more manageable. Easing the load of security staff, automated test runs can be executed routinely, consistently, and across multiple locations, leaving any aspiring red teamer to focus only on high-priority areas. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"where-the-tough-gets-going\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>Where the Tough Gets Going</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#where-the-tough-gets-going\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Not all a hedge of roses, there are some thorns that companies need to clip to get the full potential out of their Threat Exposure Management initiatives. </p>\n<p>When it comes to EAP, it's important to get thinking beyond compliance and CVSS scores. A mind shift is required from viewing assessments as tick-box activities. In this limited context, vulnerabilities are listed as isolated threats, and you'll end up missing the difference between knowing there are vulnerabilities and prioritizing those vulnerabilities according to their exploitability and potential impact. </p>\n<p>On the AEV side, one challenge is finding the right technology solution that will cover all bases. While many vendors offer attack simulations and/or automated penetration testing, they're typically seen as distinct functions. Security teams looking to validate both the true effectiveness of their security controls and the true exploitability of security flaws may choose to implement multiple products separately.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\" id=\"the-going-get-proactive\" class=\"anchor-heading\"><strong>The Going Get Proactive</strong><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#the-going-get-proactive\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The evolution of the CTEM framework since its introduction two years ago indicates the growing acceptance of the critical need for a proactive risk exposure reduction mindset. The new categorization presented in the Hype Cycle reflects the growing maturity of products in this space, supporting the operationalization of CTEM.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the AEV category, our recommendation is to use a solution that will seamlessly integrate BAS and penetration testing capabilities, as this is not a common feature for most tools. Look for agentless technologies that accurately replicate attacker techniques and ease operational demands. This unique combination ensures that security teams can validate their security posture continuously and with real-world relevance.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how Pentera is used as an essential element of any CTEM strategy that empowers enterprises to maintain a robust and dynamic security posture, continuously validated against the latest threats.</p>\n<p>For more insight into Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM), <a href=\"https://xposure.pentera.io/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=xposure\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">join us at the XPOSURE Summit 2024</a>, hosted by Pentera, and grab the <a href=\"https://pentera.io/redirect-access-gartner-2024-hype-cycle-for-security-operations/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=gartner_hype_2024\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner® 2024 Hype Cycle for Security Operations</a> report.</p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"stophere\" id=\"hiddenH1\"></div>\n<div class=\"cf note-b\">Found this article interesting? <span class=\"\">This article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.</span> Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehackersnews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter <i class=\"icon-font icon-twitter\"></i></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/thehackernews/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> to read more exclusive content we post.</div>\n",
